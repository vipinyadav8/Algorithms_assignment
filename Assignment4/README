Pattern Matching with wildcards

In this assignment, you will learn to implement suffix trees and use them for pattern matching. You are given a long text T containing English characters, numbers (and other special characters like blank, etc.). Given a string P, you have to find ALL occurences of P in T, i.e., you have to mention the locations in T where P occurs. Recall that we say P occurs in T if there is a sequence of consecutive characters in T which is same as P. To make your program more powerful, the pattern can contain the following wildcards :
? : the wildcard ? can match any character. For example suppose 
  T = indian institute of technoligy, india 
  P = i?d? 

In this case it should match this with indi in both the first word and the last word. 
* : it can match any sequence of characters. For example suppose 
  T = indian institute of technology, india 
  P = i*i 

In this case it should match this with "indi", "indian i", "indian insti", "indian institute of technology, i", "indian institute of technology, indi", "ian i", and so on.
