I am a student of one of the renowned college of my country but my father is a lawyer in our hometown itself and my 
mother is a house maker. My sister is a student and with my fathers income we barely able to pay the fees of the 
colleges and run our house. As my father is the only person in our house who has a job and we barely able to run things 
and as I mentioned earlier. I am a student and wants to learn coding because its the thing that I wanted to learn from 
the starting and I love to learn and getting a job in future will really help me and my family As this course is one 
of the best course and can really help me a lot in future in my job and also I want am currently doing my Bachelors in 
major in chemical engineering and wants to do minor in computer science so being from a poor family and wants to do learn
something new makes me to apply for the financial aid.
